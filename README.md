Traveling Salesman Problem

This code demonstrates several different algorithms that solve the traveling salesman problem.
For a thorough explanation of the traveling salesman problem, read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem
This code was developed using a linux virtual machine using Oracle VM VirtualBox.
This code was not developed with the intention of user interaction, but feel free to look at anything. 
Please contact the author if you would like to see it in action.
